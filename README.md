# Overview
**Adventure Localizer** is a tool for adventure creators to make use of the localization fields present for adventures in Spore: Galactic Adventures. It adds 3 different cheats that interact with adventure text and localization tables, allowing players to easily convert non-localized text into localized text, and vice versa.
* `LocalizeAdventure` - Saves adventure text into a locale file and inside adventures converts it into a format compatible with the now-created locale file. 
* `SaveAdventureLocale` - Saves adventure text into a locale file, but does not convert the adventure into a localized version. Good for transcribing adventures.
* `UnlocalizeAdventure` - Converts a localized adventure into an unlocalized version, allowing the adventure to be shared online without the locale file installed to the game. Doing this also allows for the usual 192 character limit to be bypassed, proved text fields are not edited afterwards.
