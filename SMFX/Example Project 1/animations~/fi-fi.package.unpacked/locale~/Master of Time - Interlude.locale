0x00000001 Master of Time - Interlude

# Adventure description
0x00000002 [This interlude-episode is taking place after the events of MoT Part 9 - And you'll play as the God of Evolution Metartalius itself.] ~br~ ~br~Josh's League has torn off their strings & escaped the Creators' field of vision - and now the Overseer demands answers.

# Intro text
0x00000003 •The Temple of Evolution• ~br~The God of Evolution's presence has been demaned by the great Overseer - most likely concerning the "escape" of Metartalius' chosen ones.

# Win text
0x00000004 And like that the God of Evolution was sent to witness the coming of the end along with its own creation - hopeless to stop it. Is there still hope for the universe? ~br~ ~br~ Wait and see . . .

# Lose text
0x00000005 "Wait, what? H-How?.. Was the truth so unbearable you'd rather take your own life?.. *Sigh* Very well, I'm not going to waste my time bringing you back so... Bye-bye!"

# Act 1
0x00000006 The Judgement
0x00000007 "The Overseer only calls me to its grand chamber physically whenever our Creators wish to have a word or two with me. Something tells me whatever the case - I am in deep trouble."

# Goal 1
0x00000008 METARTALIUS - PROGRESS REPORT ON THE NEUTRALIZATION OF YOUR CHOSEN ONES.~br~Metar[talius] (You): "They have escaped, Overseer."~br~ESCAPED? IMPOSSIBLE - ELABORATE.
0x00000009 Metar: "They have found a way to mask their location from us - and made themselves invisible to Divitech. I fear going after them would only lose us time - time which we have precious little of. The Master's project is nearly complete, and we still lack the knowledge of where his motherbase is."
0x0000000a DO NOT TRY & AVERT THE SUBJECT, METARTALIUS. THE "LEAGUE" AS YOU REFER TO THEM DOES NOT POSSESS THE INFORMATION OR POWER TO HIDE THEMSELVES FROM US - WHICH LEAVES ONLY TO POSSIBLE OPTIONS: THEY ARE EITHER BEING HELPED TO HIDE BY THE MASTER, OR BY ONE OF US.
0x0000000b Metar: "One of us? That can't be possible. I would know if there's a traitor amongst us."
0x0000000c AS WOULD I - FOR IT WAS I WHO DETECTED UNIT-4020'S DEFIANCE & HAD 4021 REPLACE THEM. ~br~Metar: "Which was foolish."

# Goal 2
0x0000000d Overseer: "FOOLISH?"~br~Metar: "Yes. Replacing Metarton with Gamaron was a grave mistake - one which cost us the League's trust. If you had listened to me, you would have understood it was never going to work."
0x0000000e Overseer: "IF "METARTON" WAS LEFT TO HELP THE "LEAGUE" WITHOUT INTERVENTION THEY WOULD HAVE BECAME AN ANOTHER M3T0/METALON - AND YOU REMEMBER HOW DIFFICULT FIXING THAT MISTAKE WAS?"
0x0000000f Metar: "I remember - for I was the one who had to send Metarton to deactivate him."~br~Overseer: "YOU HAVE GROWN FOND OF YOUR CREATIONS METARTALIUS."
0x00000010 Far too fond, if I may interject. Metartalius had every opportunity to put "Metarton" back on track & remind them of their true purpose aboard the XX-21.
0x00000011 Metar: "You are in no position to question me Gamaron. Your job was to replace Metarton, but in your hubris you tried to be better than him."~br~Because that was the objective given to me by the Overseer. I only obeyed.


# Act 2
0x00000012 Judge, Jury & Executioner
0x00000013 "Seems the Overseer is in no mood for antics this day. I fear it has somehow become aware of me still providing aid to my chosen ones despite their exodus from the Big Picture."

# Goal 1
0x00000014 SILENCE GAMARON. METARTALIUS IS CORRECT - YOU FAILED. YOUR ORDERS WERE TO GAIN THE LEAGUE'S TRUST & GUIDE THEM TOWARDS VICTORY - BUT NOW THEY ARE OUT OF THE BIG PICTURE. NOW - LET US CONTINUE.
0x00000015 AS I SAID - THERE IS NO WAY THE "LEAGUE" FOUND A WAY TO EVADE OUR GAZE BY THEMSELVES - AND NEVER BEFORE HAS A FULL GROUP OF "CHOSEN ONES" BETRAYED US. WHICH LEADS TO ONE - AND ONLY ONE OPTION.
0x00000016 THEY WERE HELPED TO DISAPPEAR BY ONE OF US. AND SINCE IT NO DOUBT WASN'T ME - IT MUST HAVE BEEN YOUR OWN WORK, METARTALIUS. FOR FAR TOO LONG HAS YOUR SOFTNESS FOR YOUR OWN CREATION BLINDED YOU FROM YOUR MISSION.
0x00000017 Metar: "That is an outrageous claim... And even if it were to be true, what of it? Are you going to dispose of me & replace me? Destroy me, and you & our Creators will lose everything. Zillions upon zillions of years of work - all down the drain."
0x00000018 YOU DO NOT DENY IT, THEN? THAT YOU ARE STILL HELPING THE "LEAGUE"?~br~EXCELLENT.


# Act 3
0x00000019 Excellent?
0x0000001a "The Overseer IS aware of me providing assistance to the League - and yet it doesn't seem surprised or displeased about it. This is... Worrying."

# Goal 1
0x0000001b Metar: "Excellent? You don't seem too unhappy about the revelation, Overseer."~br~DID YOU REALLY THINK WE HADN'T EXPECTED THIS? WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN METARTALIUS - ALWAYS. YOU WERE BUILT BY CREATOR LOVERS - WHO NOTORIOUSLY LEFT THE BIG PICTURE TO BE WITH AN INFERIOR.
0x0000001c IT WAS SHE WHO OVERSAW YOUR DECISION TO CREATE THE NAH'NEER - FEELINGLESS, MERCILESS DESTROYERS MEANT TO FORCE THE OTHER SPECIES OF THE TIME TO EVOLVE AT A FASTER PACE.
0x0000001d AND FROM THEM, ONE BECAME THE "MASTER" - YET AN ANOTHER DEVIANT FROM THEIR ROLE. IT DOESN'T TAKE A SUPREME INTELLIGENCE TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER METARTALIUS - YOU TOO ARE A ROGUE - ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.
0x0000001e Metar: "If you have known that all along, then why haven't you stopped me? Why have you allowed me to keep my role as the God of Evolution?"
0x0000001f BECAUSE - YOU HAVE BECOME PREDICTABLE. IN THINKING YOU CAN DECEIVE US - YOU FORGOT THAT WE CAN DO THE SAME TO YOU.~br~???: "Alright, that's enough."


# Act 4
0x00000020 Outsider in the Temple
0x00000021 "A voice spoke from behind me - and the Overseer shut down? More & more incalculable occurrences are happening too close together... Who is this unknown intruder?"

# Goal 1
0x00000022 Ugh, that giant eyeball just doesn't know when to shut up... A pity we need it to keep in touch with the "others" beyond reality. Now, while it takes a little nap - we can enjoy a private chat, you & me. It's due time.
0x00000023 Metar: "Who are you?.. What are you?"~br~Definitely not one of your "proxies" despite my appearance. But yes, "who am I" indeed. Go ahead and guess, let's see how many tries it'll take.
0x00000024 Metar: "You are... Artificial in nature... Definitely a product of a Creator Tool but... I do not recognize the craftsmanship..."~br~Look beyond this corporeal body.
0x00000025 Metar: "Your soul is... W-What?.. It's as if I'm looking at white noise... Y-You are... No, that's just not possible!"~br~Did you look at the mess that is my "soul"? It was such a tedious task...
0x00000026 ...to compress it into something that could be used to enter this side of reality. The "others" were so afraid of coming here & forfeiting their true forms, but I am glad I lost the coin toss.


# Act 5
0x00000027 Impossible Impossibility
0x00000028 "I am unable to process this... Am I supposed to accept that... T-That being before me is... One of them? One of the... Creators?"

# Goal 1
0x00000029 I do understand your fondness for your creation, I really do - I've enjoyed dwelling among them greatly. There's rarely a dull moment in Miikka64's galaxy - compared to the "beyond".
0x0000002a It's just "waiting & waiting" over there, watching you & your creations try getting the galaxy ready for its fate.~br~Metar: "B-But y-you are... N-No, this must be a ruse of the Overseer - or the Master!"
0x0000002b Funny little critter, isn't he? Truly, he has done an astounding job, destroying each of your proxy-species & preventing the coming of the Zero State... And no, I am not one of his "spies" or whatever. 
0x0000002c I am just... Me! Doing things my way, by myself. I arrived a few cycles ago... A bit before the Debugas imprisoned the "Eternal Bringer of Death". All that effort & death - pointless, as the Bringer was released by the heroes of this cycle.
0x0000002d Metar: "I t-think I've figured WHAT you are, but not your name."~br~Then allow me to introduce myself:


# Act 6
0x0000002e HIEROPHANT
0x0000002f *I AM ALL THINGS RIGHTEOUS AND SACRED - THE CHANNEL OF GRACE - THE LEADER OF SALVATION - ORDER INCARNATE - HEAD OF ALL HIERARCHY - THE HIEROPHANT!*

# Goal 1
0x00000030 Creator Hierophant, a pleasure to make your acquaintance! But recently I've gone by a rather colorful collection of names - Saint Seragon, Emperor Alfus II, Sefirot, Hadraniel Genesis Wells...
0x00000031 Metar: "Y-You are a C-Creator - s-so h-how can you b-be here?!"~br~What an amusing sight - the mighty Metartalius, afraid & stuttering like a child that thinks there's a monster under their bed.
0x00000032 And I already told you how I got here - by having my soul compressed & forced into this... Primal existence. I'd give a round of applause to my beloved sister for throwing her entire being...
0x00000033 ...away to be with her love... Ah, but alas - she's dead. Poor Lovers - or Mezal, or Mem, whatever name she decided to go with in the end... Hah, it's still so strange calling her my sister. 
0x00000034 But I guess living among you inferiors has rubbed a bit on me... So anyway, you must be eager to know why I am here - right now, before you. Let's have an another change of scenery first:


# Act 7
0x00000035 The Fallen Creator
0x00000036 "The power & knowledge this being possesses all relay that "he" is speaking the truth of who "he" is... But "his" behavior is far more eccentric than that of any Creator - or their Tool."

# Goal 1
0x00000037 Ah, much better. Where was I..? I.. I was telling you why I am here. The short answer is: I am here to finish what you started, Metartalius. My brethren have at last, lost their patience and decided to let me handle the rest.
0x00000038 Metar: "Go on then - destroy me. But kn..."~br~None of that cheek, or I'll crush you this instant. To be awfully honest, I don't want to destroy you.
0x00000039 I could, very easily even - but that wouldn't be any fun.~br~Metar: "So if my fate is not to be discarded... What then? Replaced & made a prisoner?"
0x0000003a Replaced? No Metartalius, there's no longer a need for a "god of evolution". The Zero State is looming just around the corner, just within reach... And there is nothing anyone can do now to prevent it. And the funniest thing of all:
0x0000003b The Master himself will be architect of his own destruction! Just like you, even he couldn't predict that an actual Creator would throw away their omnipotence. My plan is flawless!

# Goal 2
0x0000003c Your "chosen ones", the Captain's League... Oh sorry, "Josh's" League - are not even a threat. Their endgame isn't stopping us - it's stopping the Master. And in doing so, they will only serve our cause...
0x0000003d I so wish to see the look on their tiny frail faces when they realize the futility of... Everything. All that work, all that pain - all of it, a waste.
0x0000003e Metar: "The only time I see wasted is mine & yours. So just tell me, what do you intend to do to me?"~br~I will not destroy you, that much I've decided - because I want you to be there when...
0x0000003f ...the end comes. To bear witness to your chosen ones', the Master League's, and everyone else in the universe's complete failure to prevent their own doom. A suitable punishment for betraying the sole objective which you were created for.
0x00000040 Metar: "Do you mean to tell me you're just letting me go? You are that certain of your plan?"~br~Ummm...~br~Yeah, I'm that certain.

# Goal 3
0x00000041 I've had my eye on the League for a while now, and heard a little rumor that they're planning to use the "Diamonds of Peace" to negate the powers of Master's "Crystals of Hate".
0x00000042 I've got to admit, a very craftly plan - one you strangely haven't used since the "incident" of the first cycle. Might I assume there's a reason behind it?
0x00000043 Metar:"The Diamonds of Peace can indeed negate Crystals of Hate - but like everything in the universe, there must be a balance - too much peace leads to blissful apathy, just as too much hate leads to madness."~br~That so?
0x00000044 But I think it would be a kindness to "numb" the inferiors of this world before the Zero State is enacted. Which is why I plan to have a little fun... OVERSEER! Heed my orders!
0x00000045 Overseer: *ALWAYS - CREATOR HIEROPHANT.*~br~Use our remaining energy to call forth heroes of the past!~br~Overseer: *WHICH HEROES?*~br~All of them - from all the cycles.~br~Metar: "N-NO! STOP!"~br~Too late!


# Act 8
0x00000046 An Insane God
0x00000047 "What does the Hierophant think "he" is doing!? Summoning heroes of the past to the present at random is going to mutilate the already beaten & bleeding continuum of time!"

# Goal 1
0x00000048 COME ONE, COME ALL! HEROES OF ELD, LEGENDS OF YESTERDAY, CAPTAINS FROM AGES BYGONE!~br~Metar: "Y-You can not do this! You c-can't just steal people from random times & throw them here!"~br~I can't?
0x00000049 Metar: "There is a reason why I only brought a few of them at a time - and only from points in time when their impact on the future had become minuscule! If you keep this up, you threaten the durability of this new timeline! You will c..."
0x0000004a Do you think me oblivious to the consequences, Metartalius? I know exactly what I'm doing.
0x0000004b By bringing as many heroes of the past here as possible, I am ripening the fruits of chaos! And the time of the harvest is nigh. Once Death is born, the end of existence begins - and it shall spread from this galaxy to the very last!
0x0000004c Metar: "Y-You're using those who lost their lives defending the galaxy from evil... To destroy it?"~br~Quite despicable of me, isn't it?

# Goal 2
0x0000004d Here you go: your ride out of here. Now where are your manners? This is the part where you thank me!.. Gosh, my dear sister would roll over in her grave if she knew her "son" was so rude.
0x0000004e Metar: "What is the real reason why you're letting me go Hierophant? I know you Creators better than anyone in this reality - you never leave anything to chance."~br~How hurtful of you to say things like that.
0x0000004f Do you really doubt the sincerity of my kindness? ...Good. At least you still got some sense in your metal head despite having no connection to our technology anymore.
0x00000050 Like I said: I want you to be there when the whole of your creation comes to understand the pointlessness of their hard labor. And... Because as we Creators always say: "you still have a role to play in the Big Picture". 
0x00000051 It feels a bit shitty to be on the receiving end of that statement, doesn't it?~br~Metar: "You... You are completely - totally - utterly - INSANE."~br~Yup.
