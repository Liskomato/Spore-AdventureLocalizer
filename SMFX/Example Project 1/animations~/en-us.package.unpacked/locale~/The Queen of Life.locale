# Intro text
0x00000005 Our heroes have arrived to the old town of Bleur, their goal being to reach the Bleur Castle on top of the hill. First, however, they group up.

# Win text
0x00000006 Somewhere deep within, the Ring hums in satisfaction, as it successfully manipulated events to kill Bleu...~br~...but what does that mean, exactly?~br~To be continued...

# Lose text
0x00000007 Hato lost the Ring to the gods, and thus the galaxy was doomed.~br~Do you want to try again?

# Act 1
0x00000008 Clearhum
0x00000009 The traditional city of Bleur is located on planet Clearhum, which is the capital planet of the Bleurfeet Kingdom. Ask Argutix who you are going to see, exactly, after which add everyone in your group to your crew. Finally, read the Holo-Times and then start making your way to Bleur Castle itself...

# Goal 1
0x0000000a Hato: "Argutix, tell us a bit about your friend."~br~Bleu: "Yeah, who are they? What could they possibly be doing at the royal castle?"
0x0000000b Ah, right... Yeah. You see, she happens to be really, really important, as she happens to be the very queen of this kingdom, actually!
0x0000000c Hato: "Don't tell me!"~br~Bleu: "THE Queen?!"~br~Cyborcus: "But how can then we get to Her Majesty?"
0x0000000d Don't worry, we argulates and Bleurfeets have had an alliance between each other for a long time now. The queen knows me personally, and we've been on good terms with each other ever since I became a captain.
0x0000000e Cyborcus: "Right. Still, why do I have this feeling that this is not going to be as easy as we think?"~br~Bleu: "If we encounter trouble, we can always go hide in that bar. I've heard it's a really famous tavern around these parts!"~br~Hato: "Let's group up, everyone! Cyborcus, please initiate the allying dance for all of us."~br~[Add your friends to your crew.]

# Goal 2
0x0000000f AN ANCIENT ENTITY AWOKE - AND SARADOSTRICH DEFEATED IT!
0x00000010 We just received news that tell us that an ancient monster from the times of the Masaari awoke from the white gas giant in the star system Spodeon.
0x00000011 It would've unleashed a terrible calamity upon the entire galaxy, were it not for the forces of the North Star Kingdom and their recently-returned deity Saradostrich, who personally vanquished the squid beast with the legendary Staff of Evolution! 
0x00000012 The forces of the Empire of Chaos tried to interfere with the god of order and his forces, as is their wont, but their interference did not affect the battle with the squid-like entity that much.~br~"Do you know believe that I am Spode Incarnate?" Saradostrich smiled as we interviewed him for this event. Perhaps he might be right!
0x00000013 Bleu: "Disgusting!"~br~Cyborcus: "How awful that the Saradists can distort the truth to the media like this!"~br~Argutix: "Let's move on. We can't deal with this matter right now, revealing the truth I mean."

# Goal 3
0x00000014 STOP!~br~No one can enter the castle while our lord and saviour, Saradostrich Philemon, son of Barnabas, discusses matters with the Queen of Life!
0x00000015 Argutix: "What is the meaning of this?! Don't you know who I am? I am the Queen's old friend, let us through!"
0x00000016 Our Lord Saradostrich is discussing the matters of an alliance with Her Majesty, Queen Soumadis VI! He hopes this alliance goes through so united we can throw out the forces of chaos!~br~And no, Captain Argutix, I'm sorry but even an esteemed person such as you can not enter. Yes, we know about you already thanks to the royal court.
0x00000017 Wait a second...? Captain Argutix? Wasn't he in a wanted poster I saw once? That's strange...~br~Wait! I remember now. He's part of the... Then those must be...!
0x00000018 ALERT! ALERT! The ringbearers are here! Capture them and bring them to our Lord, alive or dead!


# Act 2
0x00000019 Escape!
0x0000001a Saradostrich's armies have occupied almost the entire city! Escape them to the bar Bleu mentioned, and then think about your next moves!

# Goal 2
0x0000001b Alright, tell me everything! Why did Saradostrich's troops chase you like some hot chicken?
0x0000001c Cyborcus: (Should we tell him?)~br~Argutix: (It probably is for the best...)~br~You tell the tavern owner about your mission, what has happened to you, and what you are aiming to do next.
0x0000001d Wait wait wait, so some never-before-heard-of god who died gave you a magic ring, which just happens to be THE artefact that both Saradostrich AND Zamolate are after? What sort of nonsense is this? What do they see in that ring of yours that makes it so special to them? What's the catch?
0x0000001e Cyborcus:"They were part of the original ringbearer crew who failed in their mission 3000 years ago, and thus ascended to godhood because of it. They each believe they could kill the other if they just had the whole Ring."~br~Hato: "That's why we're wanting to see Queen Soumadis, as we've been told she knows of a secret hyperlane to the Galactic Core." ~br~Argutix: "I told them about it. I am an old friend of Her Majesty, so I know she has the keycodes and coordinates to access the lane continue our way."
0x0000001f But what makes you think my cousin will agree to help you?~br~. . .~br~Yes, I am the cousin of Her Majesty. My full name is Mario Bleur. I'm sure you've heard the rumours of the disowned noble who owns a tavern here, Captain? That is me. I should probably explain...

# Goal 3
0x00000020 Mario: "So, on to me being the Queen's cousin. So why am I not over at the Hill, among the royal court, but down here among the peasants?"
0x00000021 Mario: "Let's say it nicely - I was never interested in royal protocol and manners. I was disowned and stripped of my titles because of my disagreements with the royal family over their politics."
0x00000022 Mario: "Over time I have seen how they, and especially Her Majesty herself, have distanced themselves from the common people more and more. It allowed for the power vacuum where the Kingdom of the North Star managed to strip our kingdom from its sovereignty."
0x00000023 Mario: "You have seen how much the Saradists have suppressed the citizens under their own tyranny, yes? How they hang people even for minor transgressions, and unfortunately for our Urlegian citizens, even for their very existence? This situation wouldn't have happened if we bluebloods actually kept in touch with the people!"
0x00000024 Mario: "And what has Her Dear Majesty done to stop this? Nothing. She just lets Saradostrich stomp all over her and our human rights!"


# Act 3
0x00000025 The Open City
0x00000026 Mario has explained to you that the city runs on a currency unique to the Bleur Kingdom: the golden bleur coins. Collect enough of them to pay all of the gate tolls, or otherwise find an alternative way to the castle!~br~~br~HINT:~br~- This is the open world act!~br~- You can store items by giving them to your crew, and get them back by removing your crew members from the crew.

# Goal 1
0x00000027 Mario: "And now you know how I feel about all of this. If you necessarily still want to get to my cousin atop the Hill, you'd be best to know the city itself first."
0x00000028 Mario: "I think that at this point, those dumb Saradist guards have given up the search for you (or given orders to stop), and set up their toll gates again. They only accept the city's local coins as the currency. Your sporebucks won't work here, I'm afraid."
0x00000029 Mario: "This city is divided roughly into three districts based on the toll gates. The first of them is where we are at now: the Broad Square. Foreigners usually only get here with their money."
0x0000002a Mario: "The second district is the Tradery. This is where most of the city's marketplaces are located, it is our commercial district after all. The third district is the Foothills. It is where the most of us nobles live daily."
0x0000002b Mario: "The royal palace has its very own toll gate, and its prices are more expensive than those of the Tradery and Foothills. If you ask me, what the best way to earn Bleur's coins is, it would be to help the citizens! You would do us all a service in these dark times."


# Act 4
0x0000002c The Queen
0x0000002d You got inside the Bleur palace! You see Queen Soumadis VI discussing and debating with Saradostrich, and you all decide to interfere...

# Goal 1
0x0000002e Hato: "Saradostrich! Stop right there!"~br~Bleu: "Your lies will end here!"
0x0000002f Not now, Bearers! I have extremely important business to discuss with the Her Royal Highness here! She currently leads the Free Alliance, after that devil Zamolate went and killed the president of Oculus! I need the support of the free empires so that together, we can defeat Zamolate and his Empire of Chaos once and for all!
0x00000030 Bleu: "Is killing Spode really not enough for you?!"~br~Argutix: "Or your lackeys' occupation of Bleur City?"~br~Cyborcus: "Or how they hang innocent people?"
0x00000031 Why are you taking those off-topic and meaningless things to the table? What is your game here Bearers? That which you called "Spode" was just a collective delusion, a squid monster that was summoned by the Source Herself to dominate the Masaari!
0x00000032 Soumadis VI: "Wait, Your Divinity. I have heard of the Ringbearers, they all deserve this turn to speak, assuming they are here for the reason I suspect them to be. Speak."

# Goal 2
0x00000033 You take this chance to tell everything from your point of view, much to the chagrin of Saradostritch.~br~~br~She ponders things for a moment, and then takes her turn to speak.
0x00000034 So, you want to destroy the Ring of Fate, by casting it to the magma of Mount Ruin. A noble task. But what have you planned for the chance that our galaxy faces destruction after your mission?~br~Hato: "Wh-what do you mean?"~br~It is said in the prophecy of SporeScape, which has so far correctly predicted the return of the ring gods after 3000 years of banishment, that were all of the gods in our galaxy to die, Liskus would face its "final days", or "the disappearances" which is how the prophet Novecosanas has put it in his texts.
0x00000035 Hato: "That's... kind of bad, if you asked me, but I believe we the people of the galaxy will survive whatever comes after the Ring's fall! We can always move to another galaxy if our own faces destruction!"~br~Cyborcus: "Good Hato, think about the implications of that! But the massive logistic issue behind moving an entire galactic society besides, the warring ring gods are honestly a far greater threat to the universe than the destruction of our galaxy. Mr. Thorus Ostrillon C, before his sad passing, said that they have enough energy to battle each other until the heat death of the universe, if they felt like it. That is why we must destroy the Ring soon enough by throwing it to Mount Ruin. It is the only way to bring our universe lasting please. ~br~So please, dear Majesty: Let us into your secret hyperlane to the Galactic Core that our good friend Captain Argutix told us about!"
0x00000036 Saradostrich: "Don't you dare listen to those foolish Bearers, Your Majesty! The Ring will soon enough break all of their minds, and then it is not only Zamolate we have to worry about, but FOUR more opposing deities!"
0x00000037 Bleu: "Alright, I've heard enough! I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU!"

# Goal 3
0x00000038 Hato: "Bleu, don't!"~br~Argutix: "Don't anger that angry bird any further!"~br~Cyborcus: "Think your next words with care!"
0x00000039 Sorry guys, not listening right now.~br~~br~Listen up now, Saradostrich! What justifies everything wrong that you have done so far? What sort of madness do you have that demands you to destroy Zamolate and the other gods right away? What exactly is wrong with you?
0x0000003a Saradostrich: "You dare...!"~br~Don't say anything yet! I haven't yet finished!~br~~br~Have you ever thought how the Ring and the Staves could be affecting your mind right now? Have you ever read on their side effects or something? I certainly have, there's a lot to read about it on Trooba and Hivehat's books. I've had the great honor to have been adopted by Hivehat's distant descendant Dr. Hivepah, and I believe that should give me right enough to warn you to stop while you still can!
0x0000003b So why you, Professor Sarado Philemon, son of Barnabas, have to spoil your generation's fame, by engaging in war and destruction like a lunatic? Yes, I am calling you a lunatic! And I have the right to call you that for your murder of Spode! Of course Zamolate is also guilty, and you sometimes do right in opposing him, but that doesn't absolve you of ANY of your very own sins! You and your followers destroyed worlds, committed genocides, and did a lot of far worse things in the years following that fateful day you went on your mission with Zamo! In fact, your brother even went so far in your madness that he married the WIDOW of Barry Ostrichfeet!~br~~br~All of these things I've read about, it makes me despise you with my every gut! You tell yourself and your followers that you're a "god of order"? Bah, you're not one! You're just acting like you were one, while in reality you're just another god of chaos like Zamolate... No, A FALSE GOD!
0x0000003c Saradostrich: "WHAT. Did. You. Just. Call. ME?! ...A CHAOS... FALSE GOD?! I'LL SHOW YOU, FILTHY GIRL...!"


# Act 5
0x0000003d God's Anger
0x0000003e With a mighty lightning bolt, Saradostrich smited Bleu, killing her instantly! Horrible! What will he plan next in his angered state?!~br~HINT: Complete all goals before time runs out!

# Goal 1
0x0000003f PLAYTIME IS OVER! Hato, now you shall give me the ring for your sister's transgressions, or I will personally destroy all that is dear to you!
0x00000040 I will blow the world of life itself, Solum! Your very own dear homeworld! No, I will destroy Oculus and their little pet project to kill us! No, I WILL DESTROY THE WHOLE URANIAN ARM IF I MUST!
0x00000041 NO ONE DEFIES ME! NO ONE! I AM THE GOD OF ALL LISKIANS! I AM SPODE, LORD OF LISKUS, AND ITS SUPREME RULER!
0x00000042 Saradostrich unleashes his full Might and starts choking Hato, attempting to force the Ring out of his hands.~br~Hato: "HELP! <cough> Guys, help...! I can't... defy him! <cough> <cough>"~br~Cyborcus: "Now more than ever! We must break Saradostrich's concentration while his defenses are low!"~br~Argutix: "But of course! FOR BLEU!"
0x00000043 Soumadis: "My court and I will help you, Ringbearers! We cannot let this murder of an innocent girl go unanswered!"~br~[Ally with Argutix, and quickly! Hato is currently defenceless because of Saradostrich's mental onslaught on him!]


# Act 6
0x00000044 God's Wrath
0x00000045 Saradostrich is trying to force the Ring from Hato's hands! Stop him be reducing his HP to 0!


# Act 7
0x00000046 God's Exhaustion
0x00000047 You have stopped Saradostrich's onslaught for now... Now, demand that he leaves by speaking to him.

# Goal 1
0x00000048 Grrr.... Hrrrg... You have won this round, Bearer of the Ring. Those of your friends that remain in the mortal coil are rather troublesome...
0x00000049 Hato: "You... You killed Bleu! My sister! MURDERER!"
0x0000004a SHE DESERVED IT! The way that she insulted and slandered me, SHE HAD TO GO! ...But now, YOU!~br~[His icy glare turns to the queen.]~br~You attacked me! The beloved-by-all Queen of Life, resorting to VIOLENCE?! And with the Bleur Mafia on her toes, too! My viziers were right, it was a mistake to come here! You and your alliance is not to be trusted, it is another hive of chaos like Zamolate's!
0x0000004b Soumadis: "You murdered one of the Ringbearers, and thus showed your true colours. You truly are a wretched and pathetic being. The ring has made a shadow of the once-good professor Sarado, son of Barnabas. It is clear that the Kingdom of the North Star cannot peacefully solve this war as long as you are alive, Saradostrich. The Ringbearers are correct, the Ring must be destroyed on Mount Ruin!"
0x0000004c I see!~br~So you have chosen the final days of our galaxy by blowing up the Ring, instead of doing the obviously correct choice and giving it to ME! I shall remember this treason for as long as you all live!~br~Now, I shall make my leave then in the disgrace you prefer for me. Soumadis, you shall have the honor of explaining your mafia connections to the Bearers, I shall not be here then to hear it! Goodbye.


# Act 8
0x0000004d Sorrow
0x0000004e Your entire fellowship, along with the royal court, grieve Bleu's passing... But everyone also knows that they cannot linger here for long. It is only a matter of time until Saradostrich returns, this time with force. Speak with Queen Soumadis, Argutix and then finally Hato to move on with the quest.

# Goal 1
0x0000004f Please forgive me deeply.~br~[She bows deeply to you all.]~br~Because of my and my court's failings, you all had an incredibly hard time to get here, forced to pay the illegal tolls of the Saradist regime, and by the end of it all, lost your dear friend and sister, Bleu Hive. I am so, so, so sorry for it all... I don't know if I can ever forgive myself for failing to save an innocent life like hers.
0x00000050 Cyborcus: "Bleu..." [Your gaze turns to the ground, and the lifeless remains of Bleu.]~br~Hato: "It is not your fault, Your Highness. I know in my heart that it isn't. Bleu, she... Perhaps she knew this would be her end..."
0x00000051 And she faced her end with dignity. I know. She was a brave young woman, who put everything in line to say her word, and the truth. I don't know if I can ever be as brave as she.
0x00000052 And as a certain cousin always liked to se, the fault lies in me too. I did not do my best to help you out, as I should've.~br~...Yes, I got your message Captain Argutix. You can access the Suruz Lane by my blessings. I wasn't able to get my response to you in time because the Saradists were observing all network traffic on the planet. The censorship isn't something even I can control. I have far less power in my hands than you've been led up to believe thus far.
0x00000053 In truth, there was no way I could say no to Saradostrich before you four arrived. He has the true power over the Bleurfeet Kingdom and our capital at this point of time. Thus, I had to rely on the Bleur Mafia in order to protect myself, my court and my citizens. It was the only way we've been able to express at least some form of sovereignty, exploiting corruption within Saradist clergy and armies to rule over where they don't dare to look. It is honestly a disgrace in Bleur culture that the Queen of Life herself has had to resort to organized crime like this. Once the occupation is over and the truth comes out, I will never hear the end of it in the press. Thus, while my fame is still good among the commonfolk, I will need to step down from my throne for the sake of my younger sister, Princess Outi. She is a good girl, and extremely sharp. I'm sure she will rule over the Bleur Kingdom far better than I ever could. 

# Goal 2
0x00000054 Your Majesty, you're stepping down?! Why?
0x00000055 Soumadis: "This is for the best. Your fellowship has lost an important member, and it is best that I come to replace her for the mission."
0x00000056 Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered, but... Is that really a wise decision? Bleu, you see... she was Hato's adoptive sister and all that. Would he accept you as a member of our group in his current condition?
0x00000057 Soumadis: "If it's about not being able to move on, we can hold a funeral for her."~br~Cyborcus: "We can't stay here to handle and hold funerals. The most efficient way Hato can recover, is to get him moving and thinking of other things, especially since he's still carrying that ring of all evil. We have to go to Mortar NOW."
0x00000058 Yeah, and I think it is best if you handle the job of co-pilot for now, my tin friend. ...And Hato? Are you alright? Are you good to go now?

# Goal 3
0x00000059 Bleu! I can't believe it, she's...
0x0000005a Cyborcus approaches Hato and hugs him to comfort.~br~Cyborcus: "Don't worry Hato. We are here and now. We survived. YOU survived. That is all that matters now."
0x0000005b Yeah, but Bleu didn't make it! Why did she have to die while WE survived?? WHY US AND NOT HER?!~br~Cyborcus: "Take it easy. Breathe deep. Relax."~br~IT'S NOT FAIR!
0x0000005c You turn to the others next.~br~Cyborcus: "Hato is certainly not taking it well at all, one can see it even without a visor. We have to get going now to keep his mind occupied with other things."~br~Argutix: "So, Your Majesty..."~br~Soumadis: "Call me just Soumadis for now."~br~Argutix: "Alright, Soumadis. Tell us about the Suruz Lane if you can?"
0x0000005d Soumadis: "Very well. It is a very old hyperspace lane that goes from here in the edge of Azedi Belt in the Maridian Arm, to the Deep Core in the very center of the galaxy. It was built by LiSur, Incorporated to transfer supplies and men to that area, but later it was abandoned as the company could not sustain their colonies there any longer. Let us head to its end on this side now. My family can handle Bleu's funeral in our abscence. May the Source protect Bleu's soul on her next great journey..."

# Inspect for Act 1
0x0000005f Cyborcus: "Well, how you're feeling mister Hato? Has the ring been too much of a burden to carry? I noticed now you took my advice regarding where to hold it."
0x00000060 I don't know... When we took that big blast to the face on Oculus, I realized the ring became heavier as a result. So I took it on myself to carry it on a chain around my neck as you advised.
0x00000061 But... There was another thing I realized as well. I don't know why, but I can sense where the Ring Gods are at any given moment. It could be the Ring wants me to know where they are now.
0x00000062 Cyborcus: "You can sense the gods...? Hato, don't tell me..."
0x00000063 I'm afraid so, and I so hope it's wrong, but Saradostrich seems to be here, on this same planet. He arrived here before us like he did elsewhere, and I don't like what he's planning...

# Chatter for Act 2
0x00000064 Help! We are being chased!

0x00000066 So to find those Bleurese coins, we just have to look for people in need! Let's go, everyone!
0x00000067 Who do you think we'll meet during our sojourn through the city?~br~Cyborcus: "No idea, master Hato."
0x00000068 I feel pity for these citizens, but we have our own mission to carry.

0x0000006a It's so nice to be back to civilization! I started to get a little lonely among our books aboard the Explorer! But, there's one thing here that I CANNOT stand!
0x0000006b Cyborcus: "What's wrong?"
0x0000006c THEM! The followers of Saradostrich, the pretender! How can they still claim to follow him, when he... their god killed Spode Himself!
0x0000006d Cyborcus: "They can't possibly know that Bleu. And even if they did, they'd still follow their blue deerstrich as the one true god. You know better than that Bleu, I know it. Besides, we were the only 'neutral' witnesses there to see the Fall of Spode."
0x0000006e Yeah but what can we really do then? What can we do to change their minds? Throw the ring to Mount Ruin? We don't even know how to get there! Can we go see the Holo-Times by the way?~br~[Ally with her]

0x00000070 How horrible, to see the stranglehold the Saradists have on the citizens! What can we do to liberate them?~br~Cyborcus: "First, we need to get to the castle first."~br~Hato: "Pay the tolls!"~br~Argutix: "And have a nice little chat with Saradostrich and my old friend the queen!"~br~Yeah but that doesn't solve the issue I presented!~br~Cyborcus: "There isn't honestly we can do to help them besides doing errands for them."~br~<sigh> Damn, it was never gonna be easy, was it?
0x00000071 I understand now why you pity the Urgulates, Cyborcus. Besides the fact that you're one (or a subspecies, I couldn't possibly know), the Saradists focus most of their oppressive actions on your kind.
0x00000072 Back at Solum I couldn't have possibly known all the atrocities the ring gods were capable of doing! It's not enough that the old gods are killed, us mortals have to be dominated as well!~br~Cyborcus: "Amen, mistress Bleu."
0x00000073 I was wrong doubting you about pitying the hanged urgulate at the Tradery. Ultimately we are all equals under nature, and we can't let gods or social hierarchies decide what we are!~br~Cyborcus: "Exactly, mistress Bleu! I'll forgive you. You couldn't have known all of it on your own, thanks to Saradist propaganda. It is not right that the Urlegians are only known as servants of chaos!"~br~Argutix: "We did see some Urlegian Saradist convertees at Blahara so we know they're not a monolith!"~br~Cyborcus: "None of the species are, Captain. That's the point!"~br~Argutix: "Yeah, exactly!"
0x00000074 Let's go now! Let's get those Bleurese coins and pay our way into the royal palace!

0x00000077 Ah, I've heard news that this planet was but recently annexed to one of the North Star's protectorate states, which is highly unnusual because this happens to be the capital of the Bleurfeet Kingdom also! It shouldn't work like that, galactic laws forbid sharing star systems between multiple interstellar states! 
0x00000078 Hato: "What is a protectorate, if I may ask?"
0x00000079 Didn't you know? A protectorate is a state under supervision by another, larger state, where the latter has complete control over the former in foreign relations and possibly other matters also. With the Kingdom of the North Star, how they work is that there is the main regime which the grand viziers (and now Saradostrich as well since he's back) rule, then there's the protectorates which follow the guidelines of the grand viziers (and the god of order), and then there's protectorates OF the protectorate states, which is now where Clearhum seems to land.
0x0000007a It is a pyramid-like structure which has allowed Saradostrich's church to rule over vast swatches of the galaxy for centuries now. But here I am now again, educating young'uns about galactic history once more. Let's head out, the queen's waiting!~br~[Ally with him.]

0x0000007d You always felt like the most sociable of your family, tin guy. You possibly couldn't have found your way to Solum otherwise, eh?~br~Cyborcus: "Nope. I would've been long dead now otherwise."
0x0000007e Man, what a mess Bleur has gotten herself into after my last visit! Saradostrich's occupation must be ended, and for that reason we must get those coins and get to the Queen!
0x0000007f Listen Cyborcus, have Hato and Bleu always been that troublesome for you? Ever since their childhoods I mean?~br~Cyborcus: "Of course. Always running into the forest from home they were."~br~Hato and Bleu: "HEY! Not fair to gossip around like that!"~br~Cyborcus: "Take that."
0x00000080 We shouldn't dally around town for too long, but then again, Bleur has always been a pretty mazy place...~br~Cyborcus: "I think we four can navigate ourselves around town well enough!"

0x00000093 I think I'm starting to like Saradostrich now!
0x00000094 What good has Zamolate ever brought us? He brought us chaos rot, destroyed our homes, and blew up our planets with meteors! There's nothing good from taking his teachings into heart!
0x00000095 Once that ring is found, and the alliance between the free states and North Star is formed, then finally can Saradostrich kick that Zamolate-meanie into the curb! Then shall our galaxy see eternal peace!

0x00000098 Saradostrich at first glance seems to be our only hope... But can we really trust him? What if someone stubs his toe and he retaliates by smiting them? What if he only accepts certain "pure" species to his paradise?
0x00000099 "Saradostrich is Spode", "the Squid is Spode Himself", "Saradostrich killed the Squid to usurp him"... The comments on this article are going crazy! Who can I really trust at this point in the galaxy?!
0x0000009a Don't tell anyone, I've recently found myself in dark places around the galaxy. I've seen and heard things that the mainstream media and the elites don't want to tell us about!

0x0000009e Saradostrich only wanted to kill the giant squid creature to gain its powers for himself! There is no other logical reason!
0x0000009f How much damage have Saradostrich and Zamolate already caused with their current war? There's already so much death, disappearances, economical depression and much more going about in our galaxy right now! I hope someone does the right thing, finds the ring and throws it in the fires it was made in at the galactic core!
0x000000a0 Saradostrich is no better than his rival Zamolate. They both seek only power with ideological excuses!
0x000000a1 How did this all begin, you ask? Well, there was this ring made by the Grox... Which is the root cause of all of our troubles after the galactic society wiped those damned cyborgs out.

0x000000a4 Damn, the "gods that came" of Liskus certainly seem nastier than any other gods I know! Liskus' Spode was no match for Saradostrich with his navies and the Staff of Evolution at his side!
0x000000a5 Should I really try and return to Mikhos at this point...? But would they really accept an altered Surisin like me?
0x000000a6 There's apparently some secret weapon being built over at Barren... It can apparently destroy the "ring gods" and the Ring itself once it is ready...

0x000000ab Cyborcus: "Why don't you tell us about the secret hyperlane route then?"~br~~br~Ah, no, I'm not authorized for that, for operational security reasons. You see the Saradists occupying this city all over us, yeah? You'll have to go to the Queen for the hyperlane access codes I'm afraid. I'm sorry.
0x000000ac And I think you should try hurrying up now. I don't want the Saradists around here to know I'm associated with you Bearers. I already have enough troubles as is, being the Wills' spy and all!

0x0000011d Alright, take a seat and listen. Before I tell you about my relationship with the Queen and why I think about her the way I do, it'd be best to start with our nation's history first.
0x0000011e Our family, the Bleurs, have ruled this kingdom ever since it was founded, from the beginning of our space traveling days and first contact with other spacefarers, which dates fifty years before the Awakening of Sporix 3000 years ago. So 3050 years from our present day, in the era where Melorsia Alliance was still the dominant force around the galaxy.
0x0000011f When the first god war ended and the old galactic alliances broke down in its chaotic after years, our kingdom's independent policies and the determination of our peoples ensured that neither of the Divine Empires, none of their protectorates nor the independent authoritarian states managed to successfully conquer and colonize us. Our nation became one of the great havens of freedom, becoming equal with the likes of the Free Federation of Solum which was the largest of them by and large.
0x00000120 Our power and influence grew as we defied the Divine Empires and their offences, and ultimately we grew so influential that our ruling monarchs started be called by the title "King/Queen of Life", given we were protecting life itself from corruption by the likes of Xenolate and Peregrin Philemon, the first grand vizier of the North Star Kingdom. It helped that we were allies with the Solumians and especially the rightful bearers of the Three Staves. ~br~Hato: "Trooba and Hivehat and their families..."~br~I see you've heard of them. Good. I needn't explain further their importance to galactic history on their own.
0x00000121 The reason why you might've never heard of the Bleurs' importance to galactic history before, might be the result of the Great Treaty. We were originally signatories in the treaty itself, but resigned as its purpose became more and more about Oculian reunification than galactic peace.~br~~br~But that is old news at this point. With the gods returned, the Great Treaty might as well now be the empty paper it was in our forebears' eyes...~br~~br~[Mario looks at the fireplace with somber eyes, the flames flickering like a longing maiden.]

0x000001c3 Argutix: "What sort of people can we expect to fight in the arena?"
0x000001c4 Well, let's see... There are three other groups besides yours that have signed up for battles today.
0x000001c5 First of them fell to the armed Grankor we keep as a "pet". So you will fight them first.
0x000001c6 The second group is a lone soldier from the Holy Army of the North Star – a real top-tier gladiator if all I've heard about him is correct.
0x000001c7 And the third group... What were they named again? Oh well, who knows. You'll see them if you can reach them.

0x000001df Heino should be somewhere here, around the Foothills. He usually knows not to stray into Tradery or even the Broad Square. If he refuses to come, give him a fish or something.

0x00000244 Oh boy, developing this adventure took its time! And to think, Liskomato wrote an entire open-world adventure like this in FINNISH? Are they crazy?! And even the idea for this adventure took ten years of real life time to manifest into an adventure like this!
0x00000245 The encounter with the Queen and Saradostrich has always been a part of this episode, even when this wasn't meant to be an open-world adventure originally. The open-world part came about as Lisko realized the climactic scene at the end wasn't enough to make a proper Liskomato-grade adventure to their liking, and decided to experiment about.
0x00000246 I won't talk about the climax any further, you have to see it yourself! All I can say for now, is that your group will not be the same after.
0x00000247 And now Liskomato would like to ask you players' feedback. What was your favourite scene? Your favourite quest? What would you like to see improved in coming adventures? That sort of stuff.
0x00000248 It could be that Clearhum and this Bleur city will appear in coming adventures too, regardless of which canon they're part of, but I know things will certainly be different in those stories, once their time comes.

0x00000268 Oh goodness me, what sort of a lunatic are we against?! Ally with me now, Cyborcus, while we still have time!

# Chatter for Act 6
0x00000269 For Bleu!
0x0000026a Murderer! Barbarian!
0x0000026b I will NEVER forgive you for this, Saradostrich!
0x0000026c Let's win this fight, Cyborcus! For Bleu!

0x0000026d This, too. The god was beaten but not killed! Only managed to make him vomit, but I guess that's a win regardless.
