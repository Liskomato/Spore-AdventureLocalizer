0x00000002 SporeScape - Part 1


# Intro text
0x00000003 3000 years later... ~br~Hato is a Solumian citizen who likes exploring his homeworld. Now he has snuck out in secret with his best friend Bleu...

# Win text
0x00000004 And thus our heroes departed for Oculus, without knowing the once-banished gods would be now free to return.~br~The God War would resume...~br~To be continued...

# Lose text
0x00000005 Our heroes disappeared into the depths of the Chamber forever. At the same time, the galaxy fell into darkness.~br~I suppose you'd like to start over?

# Act 1
0x00000006 Sneaky Youth
0x00000007 You have gone outside without permission. Your adoptive father Hivepah will not like this...~br~Speak with Bleu and add her to your crew.

# Goal 1
0x00000008 Hah! Finally we got sneak past that old coot! He's already so senile, that he...
0x00000009 Hato (you): "Bleu, please don't insult our adoptive father like that. You do know he was the only reason we have a roof over our heads after the orphanage burned down, right?"
0x0000000a Blegh! Why do you always have to ruin the fun, Hato? We are adults! We no longer need supervision!
0x0000000b Hato: "Alright, fine. This was my own idea anyway. I wanted to see the caves for myself because I've heard strange things are going on in that area. And we were supposed to together, right Bleu?"
0x0000000c ...Oh yeah, that's right! That's why we snuck past Uncle Pah because he wouldn't allow us to go in there! Ally with me so we can depart!

# Goal 2


# Act 2
0x0000000d In the Depths of the Forest...
0x0000000e You're going to explore the nearby caves. They are located around the path leading right from your home. Follow the path to get there...

# Goal 1
0x0000000f Hato: "Cyborcus! What are you doing out here? I thought you were at home, taking care of..."
0x00000010 I already took care of it! I came here to stop you, because I already know what you're planning! You were planning to go see the caves, even though your Papa forbade you! He is very worried about your health, you know.
0x00000011 Hato: "Why would we be going to the caves? There's nothing in them, right?" ~br~(Hato is reminded of the landing platform at the end of the footpath they're in.) ~br~Hato: "We're just going to the end of this path. Nothing in there too, right? Just the old landing platform for visiting spaceships." 
0x00000012 Well, hmmm... Alright, but ONLY under my supervision! I must make sure, that you *don't* go in the direction of those caves. You must add me to your crew. It is the only way.
0x00000013 Hato: (Darn! I was hoping that Cyborcus wouldn't notice us... We can't go to the caves while he's watching. I see no other choice...) ~br~~br~[Ally with Cyborcus.]

# Goal 2

# Goal 3
0x00000014 Who are you? What do you want? Respond, or I'll open fire!
0x00000015 Hato: "Whoah, let's calm down here shall we? We're locals! Would you yourself explain who you are?"
0x00000016 Locals? Please forgive me this hostility! (Hopefully my ties with Oculus aren't cut now...) I'm Sergeant-Captain Argutix, from the Argulate Empire of Charonia!
0x00000017 <pant> <pant> Sorry. I had to land here as I was ambushed by what I assume to be pirates flying stolen KAAOS ships from the Zamolatian Empire. So my heartrate is still a bit up. Who were you again?
0x00000018 (You decide to introduce yourselves)~br~Hato: "My name is Hato. And these guys are..."~br~(Suddenly the entire valley is rocked by the sound of an explosion! Everyone gets startled...)


# Act 3
0x00000019 Explosion in the Middle of the Forest
0x0000001a Suddenly you hear a powerful boom! It came from the northwest! Join up with Captain Argutix and investigate things!

# Goal 1
0x0000001b What was that? We have to investigate that explosion's source now! Hey, you there! Yes, you, the tin can! You're a robot, right? Can you scan for the source of the noise?
0x0000001c (Cyborcus was insulted by that!)~br~Cyborcus: "A robot?! I am a cyborg with a proper name: Cyborcus! How dare you insult me like that! There's no worse thing than calling ME a machine!"
0x0000001d Oh, sorry Cyborcus! I, uh... Forgive me sir, it's the first time seen a cyborg like you. I almost mistook you for a highly advanced robot. ~br~Cyborcus: "Well, as long as I don't breathe ominously and start wielding a red laser sword, I should be fine. I've had this happen to me before, too."~br~I guess so. Well, can you trace where that explosion noise came from, still?
0x0000001e Cyborcus: "Well of course. You could've just asked nicely. Hold on."~br~(Cyborcus activates his scanning visors and looks around. After a few moments...)~br~Cyborcus: "The explosion came from somewhere west, give or take north or south. There is an old altar over there."
0x0000001f Alright! Ally with me, my friends, so we can get there together!

# Goal 2

# Goal 3
0x00000020 Hato: "That's strange. I didn't know 'the great seal' hid a cave entrance behind it." ~br~Cyborcus: "It has been breached, Hato. That is not a good thing in my eyes. No simple explosion can do that easily." 
0x00000021 Bleu: "What was I saying just now?! There are weird folk skulking all around here! They must already be inside, stealing and robbing everything they can get in their graspers! We have to get after them, for cultural preservation!"
0x00000022 Cyborcus: "But... We can't"~br~Sini: "Are you a living being or not, Cyborcus? You're just as much of a wetpants as Hato is!"~br~Hato: "HEY! Not cool, Bleu!"~br~Cyborcus: "Alright then. We head inside. Master Pah will not like this one bit, let me tell you..."
0x00000023 Argutix: "We should be wary while underground! It could be full of danger! Better that we stick together for now."
0x00000024 You enter the cave behind the Great Seal.


# Act 4
0x00000025 Secrets of the Caves
0x00000026 HINT: ~br~- Speak with Cyborcus before heading further inside.~br~~br~- While you're in the caverns, look around you. Some creatures might need your help in some cases.

# Goal 1
0x00000027 Could it be? The legendary 'Chamber'? Hmmm....
0x00000028 Hato: "Chamber? Could you explain, Cyborcus? What are you talking about?"
0x00000029 Oh yeah. I should explain. I've read from our home's many history books that somewhere deep inside Solum is located 'the Chamber', which is supposed to be the residence of 'the Sleeper'. 
0x0000002a Said 'sleeper' is said to be the entity that banished the Two Gods three thousand years ago, before Solum was colonized by the first Oculians. Archaeologists have been trying to find this place for centuries now without success. Imagine the fame we are going to get from finding this ancient place!
0x0000002b Bleu: "Yeah yeah, sounds interesting and all, but can we get on with it? We need to catch those graverobbers!"

# Goal 2
0x0000002c WHO. ARE. YOU? WHAT. DO. YOU. WANT?
0x0000002d Hato: "Uhhh... We... I mean..."
0x0000002e SO. YOU. HAVE. COME. TO. MURDER. SPORIX! YOU. ARE. SERVANTS. OF. EVIL!
0x0000002f Hato: "What? We aren't planning any murders! We didn't even come here to... Wait, who's Sporix?"
0x00000030 SARADO. ZAMO. XENOLATE. RECUSANT. SIGIL. ENEMIES! MUST. DESTROY. ENEMIES! INVADERS

# Goal 3
0x00000031 Ah, greetings! Did you come here to witness this historical moment?
0x00000032 Argutix: "Stop right there! My name is Argutix, I am the Sergeant-Captain of the Argulate Empire! What are you planning to do with Sporix?"
0x00000033 HAH! Captain or no, you have no power in this realm of gods, especially below the mighty Zamolate! I happen to be the last of his remaining clones in this magnificient "Origin World".
0x00000034 My friends and I have planned the destruction of this metal ball, ever since it banished our master from this universe! I'll be so glad to be there to witness his return, once he returns from the Realm of Chaos with Sporix dead!
0x00000035 Oh wait, you're wondering "How do I kill a god?" You see this thing I'm wielding? It is the Staff of Birth, one of the Three Hallows. Now it shall be turned against its master!


# Act 5
0x00000036 A Historical Moment
0x00000037 Witness as the last remaining clone of Zamolate decides to commit deicide.

# Goal 1


# Act 6
0x00000038 A Dying God
0x00000039 Sporix was seriously injured by the blow Zamolate's clone did to him! Examine his wounds! The murderer himself was fortunately annihilated the moment he struck, but he still managed deal a mortal blow to the god of balance...

# Goal 1
0x0000003a Aaarrrghhh.... What was that? Who dares...
0x0000003b Hato: "Sporix! Are you alright? We're so sorry! It... It was... a Zamo..."
0x0000003c A Zamolate clone? And it carried the Staff of Birth, yes? 
0x0000003d Hato: "Yes... What are the damages? Are we able to fix you by any means? You're a machine, surely we can find spare parts for you?"
0x0000003e I'm sorry, but... You can't. That Staff of Birth was not the real thing, but a copy that the God of Chaos was able to replicate with his grown power over the Lifely Hallow. I should've known... I'm sorry... I don't have much time left...
# Goal 2
0x0000003f "Much time left?" Are you saying you're about to die? But you can't! You're a god! You're not able to die! Many have faith in you and pray for you!
0x00000040 Sporix: "I'm afraid that not even gods are immune to death. It is the only certainty of the universe. Death will come for each and every one of us. Remember that, Bleu."
0x00000041 Wait, hold on, how do you know my name? We didn't even tell you our names!
0x00000042 Sporix: "Oh, Bleu... Have you not realized it yet? You're adopted children of Hivepah! And he happens to be last scion of Hivehat's family. Did he never tell you that?"
0x00000043 No... This is the first time we've heard about Papa's lineage. Could you tell us more about that?

# Goal 3
0x00000044 . . .~br~So Master Pah's family has been protecting you this whole time from the ring gods' minions? And we are now your last Guardians?
0x00000045 Sporix: "Yes. I would have one more task for you."
0x00000046 Oh! What could that be?
0x00000047 Sporix: "Take the Grox emperor's ring, this Ring of Fate, and bring it to the volcano called 'Mount Ruin' in order to be destroyed. That way, the last legacy of the Recusant shall be destroyed, and with that, his will and soul both. The original sin of both the People and us gods."
0x00000048 Sporix: "The ring is now inside me. Once I self-destruct because of my mortal wounds, it will reform itself before you. Farewell, and may the Source guide you always!"


# Act 7
0x00000049 The Fateful Ring
0x0000004a Sporix is dead, and it means only one thing... Speak with your friends and return home. Remember to pick up the Grox Emperor's ring before you exit the Chamber. 

# Goal 1
0x0000004b Well, I guess that's it then. Sporix is dead. Now what do we do?
0x0000004c Bleu: "Well isn't it clear? We destroy the ring by bringing it to that volcano the metal ball told us about. It has to be somewhere, right?"
0x0000004d But we don't even know where it is! It could be anywhere, the center of the galaxy, the territory of the divine empires, the edge of the bleeding known universe! Where do we start looking?
0x0000004e Hato: "Uncle Pah knows. He kept this whole secret about his family protecting Sporix from us. Surely, if his ancestor truly is the legendary Grox-defeating hero Hivehat, he would know more about the true nature of all things? We must tell him Sporix is dead now anyway, and that the Ring is now in our hands."
0x0000004f Alright... Hato, since you were so eagerly talking about it, I'll let you be the "ringbearer". Grab it from the ground and let's go home to talk to your papa.

# Goal 2

# Goal 3
0x00000050 Hato and Bleu! Where have you been? I've been so, so worried about you! ...And WHO is that space clown and what he is doing with you? Some new friend of yours? Pah! I don't want him inside our house! Get lost!
0x00000051 Hato: "Wait, Uncle Pah! Let me explain..."~br~(You explain everything about today's events, both in the forest and in the Chamber.)~br~Hato: "And could you explain why have you been keeping this all a secret from us? You could've easily trusted us!"~br~(Uncle Pah is clearly not himself after hearing about Sporix's death.)
0x00000052 Wh.. Wha... WHAT?! Sporix... dead?! The ring... with you?! And Zamolate... Murderer!? Ohnononnonononononono! This is horrible! No, outright TERRIBLE! Do you realize what you have done, kids? The whole galactic status quo, the entire reason our galaxy has had peace for three millenia... All of it, GONE! Like dust in the wind!
0x00000053 Alright. I confess. Hivehat is my ancestor in a direct lineage, and I am indeed the last scion of the Hive family on planet Solum. I kept this all a secret from you, because I loved you and I did not want to share all of my galactic burdens with you. I was hoping I would be able to live a quiet life before I died, and that my brother would at least see some sense and return here to protect Sporix once I was gone. But now... Everything I've known here on Solum, the entire reason my ancestors came here back in the day... It's all gone now. And I honestly don't know what to do now. I was dreading the day the ring gods' forces would invade this planet, enter the chamber and kill Sporix and all of his sporids, that I wasn't thinking that they would attempt more sneakier methods. Which I guess is why I'm partly glad you told me all about this now. You were honest – especially about this galactic crisis that has just now been unleashed.
0x00000054 This just means that... it is time. I have to make contact with my old friend on Oculus, Thorus Ostrillon C (the hundreth). He knows what you must do with the ring, and where you must take it.


# Act 8
0x00000055 To Oculus!
0x00000056 Hivepah has instructed you to meet with the famous scientist, Thorus Ostrillon C. Ask him for more information, then speak with Argutix and depart with his ship. 

# Goal 1
0x00000057 Hato: "Thorus Ostrillon C? Who is he?"
0x00000058 The scion of the hundreth generation of the illustrious Ostrillon line! He and his family are behind many of the great galactic inventions in the past three thousand years. 
0x00000059 If someone were to know all about the Ring, 'twould be him. He has dedicated his whole life for investigating the connection between the Three Staves and the One Ring. He if not anyone else can surely help you know where Mount Ruin lies?~br~Hato: "You don't know yourself, Papa?"~br~Unfortunately, no. That knowledge was lost to our family somewhere around 1500 years ago, when the Cyberbugs attacked our system and almost wiped us all out. It was a horrible time, let me tell you. 
0x0000005a As of today, Thorus lives in the city of Trooba City on planet Oculus. My estranged brother, Hivebah, also happens to live there. The two fortunately know each other well, so if you cannot reach one, the other can easily help!
0x0000005b Oh yeah, one more thing. If something happens either here or on Oculus, send my brother my regards. He can be a bit... bitter about my sentimentality sometimes.

# Goal 2
0x0000005c So we are heading to Oculus then? Excellent! I was just about to head over there myself, if I wasn't ambushed by pirates that is. I was supposed to have a business meeting with some of its elites, but that can wait for now with this galactic quest in mind!
0x0000005d Which was, I think, getting to show the Ring to this professor Ostrillon guy. And finding out where this Mount Ruin is for you kids.
0x0000005e Hato: "And what then? What do we do once we destroy the Ring?"
0x0000005f Hmm... I guess we each go our own ways, me back home to Charonia and you here in Solum. Not really something I would fuss about as you now, kiddo. You need to keep your ring secret and safe. You are carrying a most sacred artefact of the gods, after all!
0x00000060 Well, I guess the fact that we are holding the most valuable artifact in all of the galaxy won't make us a walking target for a spell. Let's get back to my ship. It should be still where I left it, before this whole god-killing day really got going!

Crime began to be commonplace, and once the greatest tragedy Oculus saw, Zamolate's invasion and losing two of the Three Staves happened, people began to drown their despair and mourning lost friends and family in booze. And that, perhaps, also helped to see Treco Truck I rise to power as king, as the citizens had just enough of all the misery they were experiencing at that time.

0x00000655 If there is one vice the usually virtuous Oculians are known for, it'd be either alcohol or gambling. Perhaps it is telling that alcohol consumption began to be commonplace as the Oculians learned how agriculture worked through the rapid development of their intelligence during the tribal and civilization stages.

# Chatter for Act 1

# Inspect for Act 1
0x0000065a A real gun from the Matrix conflict, circa 1500 AS. Around that time, the vicious Cyberbugs invaded our galaxy from another dimension.
0x0000065b They almost managed to conquer the entire galaxy, until two Hiveraiders managed to crawl out victorious from planet Solum. They themselves were distant descendants of Hivehat. 
0x0000065c They fought bravely side by side with the resistance movement led by Morphine and Voldo. Finally, the Cyberbugs would be banished from our galaxy.
0x0000065d Unfortunately, this war would have terrifying consequences – half of all the species in the entire galaxy had gone extinct. Even the god war between Saradostrich and Zamolate, and the spread of chaos rot from the latter, did not have this far-reaching death toll. 
0x0000065e Even today, scientists cannot pinpoint which dimension the Cyberbugs originally came from, or what their origin actually was. Some believe Xenolate, the feared "Recusant", was behind the entire conflict from the start, but there was no proof from his involvement given he hadn't been seen at that point for over a thousand years.
