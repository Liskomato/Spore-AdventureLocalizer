# Adventure description
0x00000002 The Grox Wars~br~Part 2~br~After discovering incriminating evidence on the Grox's weakness, Trooba and Hivehat have rushed immediately to New Domino, to the imminent Galactic Conference, where they plan to reveal this information to the rest of the galaxy...

# Intro text
0x00000003 Trooba and Hivehat have arrived at New Domino, and the island serving as the hub for the Galactic Conference, the highest interstellar meeting in the whole galaxy. They are about to head over to border control now...

# Win text
0x00000004 Trooba's speech at the Conference was a great success - It united the whole galaxy! The Grox will not like this one bit...~br~To be continued...

# Lose text
0x00000005 Xeno's Covenant managed to silence Trooba, and the Grox were never defeated. Do you want to try again?

# Act 1
0x00000006 The Conference Island
0x00000007 You have arrived at the Conference Spaceport. Speak with Trooba, after which head over to the customs officer.~br~~br~ After you've dealt with your paperwork, head over to Hotel Argole to meet with Trobba and the others.

# Goal 1
0x00000008 Okay, so we've arrived to the Conference island, but I can't see Trobba or the others anywhere. I can see the TCFS shuttle, but no crew in sight!
0x00000009 Hivehat (you): "Ugh, have you already forgotten that we've yet to pass customs? This planet has very tight security, you know. I think our friends have already passed the border and are already waiting for us over at Hotel Argole, where we were supposed to meet anyway."
0x0000000a Oh yeah, that was it! Forgive me, Hivehat, but I can't contain my excitement about Snowhut's notes, and what sort of ramifications they could really have! We could change history, no, the current status quo completely!
0x0000000b Hivehat: "Yes, obviously we will. It's just dependent on how good you're at talking. Which I know you will be, otherwise we wouldn't be here. But now let's get that border control done and dealt with."
0x0000000c Right, right! Lead the way, Hivehat!

# Goal 2
0x0000000d Your passports and other travel documents, please!
0x0000000e Trooba and Hivehat go through the customs by first giving their galactic passports, declaring their ship and goods, and then stating their purpose of visit: The Conference
0x0000000f Trooba and Hivehat, I presume? Captain Urgus of the Melorsian Alliance wanted to leave two messages for you. First, your friends are waiting for you at hotel Argole, found opposite of the conference building on the main plaza. 
0x00000010 Troopa: "Good to have confirmation! What is the second message he sent?"
0x00000011 A warning. There may or may not be a conspiracy against you. The Grox have their eyes everywhere, even inside our own borders. Do please be careful of any suspicious individuals along your way, alright?

# Goal 3
0x00000012 Greetings, Trooba! Long time no see! How you've been, pals!
0x00000013 Trooba and Hivehat explain their adventures on the surface of Lavaliben, exploring the library, finding Snowhut's notes, and their daring escape. ~br~Troopa: "And that is why we reserved a turn for our republic at the Conference."
0x00000014 Whoah, what adventures! One wouldn't easily believe half the tales you just told! Are you saying the Grox are weaker than what they show? Then that's life-changing, no, really ground-breaking!
0x00000015 I did as you asked, Trooba, and brought the entire Grand Council with me. Some of them would've already come here as observers, but at your request everyone came.
0x00000016 Speaking of which... The Conference is about to begin! The first few representatives of each space empire are about to arrive already! And our own guys are just behind the hotel's doors, coming right about... Now.


# Act 2
0x00000017 Time for the Conference!
0x00000018 The Galactic Conference is about to commence, as signs of it are about to become large and obvious. Speak with Trooba City's mayor and head to the Conference building to sign up.

# Goal 1
0x00000019 It has been a while, Trooba! How goes the Trooba X... Wait, now is not the time for that.
0x0000001a Trobba has told me what has been going on with you lately: You found evidence about the Grox's weakness, and want to show it to the galaxy. 
0x0000001b  I see now what the words the fortune teller told your father was all about (yes, your father did tell me about that once when you were little). You hold the keys to unite the galaxy as a whole.
0x0000001c You must hold a very good speech now, and make an impression to all the political powers that are present here. I trust you will be able to do it, Trooba. I know you will! But now let's get to the conference building proper! It's opposite of Hotel Argole here.

# Goal 2
0x0000001d Hey, you! Back to the end of the line!
0x0000001e Hivehat: "But we couldn't know that there even is a line!"
0x0000001f Yeah yeah, pretenses, excuses, lies! Wait for your turn! As if I have enough trouble calming down this troublesome dwarflate here!
0x00000020 Hivehat: "Fine, back to the line we go... What now, Trooba?"~br~Trooba: "While we wait in line, your cousin Hivepi suggested that you two check some places in the town he's concerned about."
0x00000021 Trooba: "Add him to your crew so you two don't get so easily separated. Don't worry about us, we'll be fine!"

# Goal 3


# Act 3
0x00000022 Remote Shadows
0x00000023 Hivepi wants you to follow him in tailing a suspicious captain. Follow the target on the map to get where you need.~br~~br~HINT: ~br~Speak with the captain from further away so his advanced behaviour doesn't break when you get close.

# Goal 1
0x00000024 Hivepi: "This is the guy I talked about, Hat-cousin! Isn't he so suspicious? Just standing there menacingly and...?"
0x00000025 Menacing? I'll show you menacing! Let me come closer so I can...
0x00000026 Hivehat: "Wait! Forgive us my friend's behaviour, he has a certain... 'tendency' to jump to conclusions like that. We'll just... be along our way and such. Do please excuse us."
0x00000027 Well, that's fine! If you'll now 'excuse' *me*, I have some places to be! Goodbye!
0x00000028 Hivehat: "Hivepi, next time don't be so loud when near your target! But you're right about one thing. He's an anjurpa. They are allies of the Grox, which means he might be on some shady business here. Let's keep a low profile for now and follow him from some distance."

# Goal 2
0x00000029 Hivehat: "Hide! We cannot be seen here!"~br~You and Hivepi hide behind the fountain and eavesdrop on the conversation...
0x0000002a Aakere: "Good news, Master! Trooba has arrived, which means our plan proceeds apace."
0x0000002b Excellent work, Number VI! Once Trooba is dead and buried, Xeno's Covenant will reward you and your empire *handsomely.* Not to mention how happy my clients will be afterwards.
0x0000002c Hivepi: "Oh my god, they're going to kill Trooba! What are we going to do?!"~br~Hivehat: "Pi, stay quie-"
0x0000002d Who's there? Number VI, deal with these pests!

# Goal 3


# Act 4
0x0000002e Dangerous Conspiracy
0x0000002f You have discovered that this "Xeno's Covenant" is about to assassinate Trooba before he gets a chance to speak! Escape them and warn your best friend about them!

# Goal 1
0x00000030 Hivepi and Hivehat! Where have you been!? We have been waiting for you so we could sign up for real!
0x00000031 Hivehat: "I have to warn you! There's a conspiracy against us! There's this 'Xeno's Covenant' and the Grox might've hired them to kill Trooba!"
0x00000032 Yeah yeah, who believes those lies? Did your "Pi-cousin" perhaps bring you to a bar to drink yourselves into a stupor?
0x00000033 Hivehat: "What the hell, Mr. Mayor?! You know as well as I that we..."~br~Trooba: "Enough! Let's hear out what Hivehat has to say. I believe he has no reason to lie about this."
0x00000034 Trooba: "Hivehat, please tell us everything, from start to finish. This considers especially *my* safety so we need to know."

# Goal 2
0x00000035 Hivehat: "Okay, so Hivepi told me about this shady space captain loitering around Hotel Argole, so we tailed behind him for a while and came across a 'hidden' meeting at a pier on the edge of the island."
0x00000036 Hivehat: "There, the captain talked with a heavily robed creature who then talked about 'Xeno's Covenant' and their 'clients' rewarding the captain and his people handsomely once Trooba was dead. It seems the anjurpa was also part of that same cabal, as the creature called him 'Number VI'. I worry who the first five 'numbers' are."
0x00000037 I fully believe you, Hivehat. And everyone else should as well. It's clear now what is going on here.
0x00000038 The Grox are still after us, even here in New Domino. Like that customs official said, they have allies everywhere we look. But we cannot falter, nay, we WILL NOT falter! I will still hold that speech and reveal their insidiousness to all in the galaxy!
0x00000039 I trust that you guys will stop this conspiracy against us while I handle my speech. But for now, let's get ourselves signed up! 

# Goal 3
0x0000003a Alright. So you are the representatives of the Interstellar Republic of Oculus? I see you have a turn reserved on our list and that one of you is having a speech before the audience. That right?
0x0000003b Trooba: "Yes, that's it. I am the speaker in question, my name should be visible there."
0x0000003c Alright, let's see... Yes. You have been reserved the last turn for today, after the Urgulate v. Dipsye debate and settlement courts.
0x0000003d As you have been the last ones to arrive, we will now close the doors and commence the Galactic Conference. Please, follow me. I will lead you to your seats. And do forgive me for yelling earlier, I've had a bad day today.
0x0000003e The official leads our friends to their seats in the conference hall. The Galactic Conference has begun...


# Act 5
0x0000003f The Galactic Conference
0x00000040 Some hours pass before Trooba's turn to speak arrives. Now that it has, you feel Xeno's Covenant might strike at him now, so you decide to add Hivepeter and Trobba to your crew...

# Goal 1
0x00000041 "Now that we have settled the matter of Hill City between the Urgulate and Dipsye Empires, next in turn to speak is the representative from the Republic of Oculus. Trooba, the floor is yours."
0x00000042 Trooba: "Thank you mister. Ahem...~br~~br~Greetings! My name is Trooba. Some may know me as the national hero of Oculus, or as the chosen, pure-hearted wielder of the Staff of Evolution. Some may know me from the news, or from historical documents detailing our nation's history. Or even from the missions I have done for my Republic."
0x00000043 Trooba: "You may be wondering why I am talking to you here today. Am I here to talk about the Staves? What my personal opinion about their usage is? Or how they should even be used, if at all? No, no. I'm here to talk about the Grox."
0x00000044 Trooba: "I have recently visited the planet Lavaliben, which got destroyed by the Grox Empire's forces as I left, and with the blessings of the late Eduard Snowhut (may he find peace in the afterlife), received his notes and book on the Grox: the aptly-named 'Greatest Secrets of the Grox'. I'd like to introduce their contents here and now..."
0x00000045 Suddenly you get the feeling that something horrible is about to happen. You decided to ally with Trobba and Hivepeter in order to counter this threat.

# Goal 2

# Goal 3


# Act 6
0x00000046 Stop the Conspiracy!
0x00000047 "ALERT! Intruders reported on floor 2F. Security forces are asked to counter them immediately!"~br~It looks like Xeno's Covenant is making its move! Stop them!

# Goal 1
0x00000048 No need to worry! This is just a routine burglar alarm! Our guards will take care of the security threat in the meantime, carry on! 
0x00000049 After reassuring the crowd the security guard turns towards you. He looks panicked.
0x0000004a Xeno's Covenant is here! They are heavily armed and have placed explosives on the second floor, right above us! If they are allowed to succeed, the whole building will collapse! As I see you are heavily armed, we were hoping you'd be able to help!
0x0000004b Hivehat: "But of course! My best friend's life is in danger, not to mention others', so of course we'll help you to stop this conspiracy on its tracks! No need to ask!"
0x0000004c Th-thank you! Please, take this key and place it in the jump pad behind the building. It will bring you to the storage room where the Covenant has made their base. Some of our guards are already there but they will only open fire when you arrive. Godsspeed!

# Goal 2
0x0000004d We KNEW you would come here to stop us. We have already prepared for you, see!
0x0000004e Hivehat: "Why are you doing this, of all things? Why are you trying to stop us?"
0x0000004f Because, if the Grox are destroyed, as you would very much hope, the ensuing power vacuum will lead the galaxy to turmoil. And we CANNOT allow that!
0x00000050 We waste too much time asking these meaningless questions. Number III! Hurry up with those explosives! We must stop 'the Eye' before he can finish his speech!
0x00000051 Hivehat: "You will NOT win this fight! Come on guys, let's stop this cabal for good!"

# Goal 3


# Act 7
0x00000052 The Moment of Truth
0x00000053 You have foiled the conspiracy's plot to collapse the conference building to prevent Trooba's speech. Dismantle the bomb and return to the conference hall to hear the conclusion of Trooba's speech.

# Goal 1
0x00000054 Now that you've routed the Covenant, you focus on dismantling the explosives and making them harmless. Some time afterwards, you are successful and have saved the Conference in the process. 
0x00000055 Hivepi: "We won! Now that covenant will surely not mess with us again!"~br~Hivehat: "I doubt it, but I'm sure they know their affairs now."
0x00000056 Trobba: "I received a call from Trooba City's mayor. Trooba is finishing his speech in a few minutes and he wants us to hear its conclusion!" 
0x00000057 Hivehat: "Well, let's humour him then by coming back downstairs."
0x00000058 Hivepeter: "You bet! Let's see how Trooba's going to make it!"

# Goal 2
0x00000059 Fine, we will concede for now. But know that we will continue to work against you, for eternity if we must.
0x0000005a Our Master has accepted that he has lost this round. He knows the Grox will now be destroyed, so he has started executing his backup plan.
0x0000005b You, Hivehat, are his "Missing Link". He didn't expect your intervention, but also that you are the knot that ties Trooba to his fate.
0x0000005c Well, I will be seeing you lot. I will be expecting you when you inevitably come to beg our help once the God War breaks out. Adieu!

# Goal 3
0x0000005d Aah, you arrived just in time! I was just about to finish my presentation!
0x0000005e So, my conclusion is the following: The Grox might be really strong, they may have superior military might, but in sheer numbers they are outmatched by the amount of stars they have versus to ours.
0x0000005f What I have been after with this speech is that we should all unite our forces against the Grox while they are weak. If we strike while the iron is hot, our blade will be unstoppable! 
0x00000060 So let's forget our old differences, if only for a moment, and break our way to the Galactic Core! It's time its secrets are to become public knowledge!
0x00000061 There ends Trooba's speech. And after some few minutes of silence and contemplation... One by one, each allies throws its support for Trooba and the Republic of Oculus in their plan to take on the Grox.


# Act 8
0x00000062 The Galaxy is United!
0x00000063 Trooba's speech had the desired effect, and now all of the galaxy's empires have united their forces against the Grox! Speak with Trooba about this victory!

# Goal 1
0x00000064 We did it, Hivehat, we did it! We united the galaxy against the Grox! How did you like my speech?
0x00000065 Hivehat: "Well, you know I didn't hear all of it because... you know why. But it was great nonetheless!"
0x00000066 Don't worry about it, it was just a lot of numbers and galaxy charts. But the important thing is now, we stopped the conspiracy and can now attack the Grox at full strength! 
0x00000067 The anjurpa you said was part of the conspiracy seems to be among the crowd, and he doesn't look happy! Can you perhaps go check him out and "rub it in"? Heh...

# Goal 2
0x00000068 What, WHAT?! Where are all the other Covenants? Were we beaten?
0x00000069 Hivehat: "How is it feeling now, mister? Feeling the bitter chalk of loss?"
0x0000006a Well I'll be damned, if it isn't the guy who stalked me! Lest you know, I am Aakere! Head Captain of the Anjurpa Empire, and proud ally of the Grox Imperium!
0x0000006b As a citizen of Anarrocko I see no other course but declare war on you and your petty little "alliance". You will not see yourselves alive even when you're not at the Grox's border. 
0x0000006c And I can be certain that the Grox will wipe you off the map as well. Have a nice and gruesome death, Oculians!

# Goal 3
0x0000006d I'm so proud of you, my dear Trooba, and so would be your parents and the old alphas if they were still alive!
0x0000006e But now, we must be vigilant! These events often have far-reaching consequences, some even coming out of left field!
0x0000006f Firstly, we have received the attention of the Grox.~br~Secondly, we must be the ones to lead this newfound alliance against the Grox. It won't be easy. Arguments will be aplenty.
0x00000070 I think we ourselves might still have one, final battle against Groxkind. A battle that'll be even fiercer than the Destructive War and the Ducky Crisis combined!
0x00000071 So let us return back to our ships, and get to action! Death to the Grox! ~br~Everyone: "Death to the Grox! Death to the Grox! DEATH TO THE GROX!"
